## Using Express Folder Layout
Pretty much going back to the beginning of the Loc8r book here, so that we can start of with a simple website that works. Can go to a functioning homepage. Has bootstrap installed in public folder. Amelia is referenced as a stylesheet in app_server/views/layout.jade, but this definitely needs changing

Should run locally on localhost:3000
It works on mine, so if you get errors please write them in this README

- Don't forget to comment all your code so others know what's going on!
Check and make sure you are running node version v4.2.1 and npm version 2.14.7... I'm not sure how it works exactly but things will go wrong if you aren't
