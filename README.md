## Construction through chapter 8 of the book

##Do this!
- Always confirm it works locally and on heroku
(Runs locally on localhost:3000, AND use heroku local, at localhost:5000)
- Don't forget to comment all your code so others know what's going on!
- Check and make sure you are running node version v4.2.1... I'm not sure how it works exactly but things will go wrong if you aren't. I wasn't somehow, had to reinstall Express and nodemon
