## Using Express Folder Layout
Pretty much going back to the beginning of the Loc8r book here, so that we can start of with a simple website that works. Has bootstrap installed in public folder.

##Do this!
- Always confirm it works locally and on heroku
(Runs locally on localhost:3000, AND use heroku local, at localhost:5000)
- Don't forget to comment all your code so others know what's going on!
- Check and make sure you are running node version v4.2.1... I'm not sure how it works exactly but things will go wrong if you aren't. I wasn't somehow, had to reinstall Express and nodemon

## Random Tricky things
- in Review page, date field dependent on what play they saw, don't know how to work that
- Don't know how to center things very well, like the temporary Results button at home page
- I can't get \n to start a new line in othersControllers.js, and I have no idea why
