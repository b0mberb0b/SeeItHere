This folder contains back-end code. Controllers get a request from API_routes and they make a request to the database, once they get a response from the database they forward a response to the front-end controllers. Documents in models folder layout the structure of the database, letting controllers interact with the database.

## Under Heavy Construction
No interaction with the front-end right now. Only two GET commands actually constructed, everything else just simple filler.
